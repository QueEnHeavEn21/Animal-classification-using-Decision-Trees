# Animal Classification with Decision Trees

Welcome to the Animal Classification project using decision trees! This repository contains all the files and instructions you need to run and understand the project. The main implementation is carried out in Google Colab.

## Repository Contents

- *GitHub_Assignment.ipynb*: This is the core Jupyter notebook where you'll find the entire implementation of the decision tree model. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- *animals.csv*: This dataset includes various features of animals that are used for classification.
- *vertebrate(4).csv*: An additional dataset focusing on vertebrate animals with specific features relevant to classification.

## How to Get Started

### Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:
- A Google account
- Access to Google Colab

### Steps to Run

1. *Clone the Repository*: First, clone this repository to your local machine.
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animal-classification-decision-trees.git
   

2. *Upload to Google Drive*: Once cloned, upload the repository to your Google Drive.

3. *Open in Colab*: Navigate to GitHub_Assignment.ipynb in your Google Drive and open it with Google Colab.

4. *Run the Notebook*: Simply run each cell in the notebook sequentially. All preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization steps are already implemented. You only need to execute the cells to see the results.

## Project Workflow

The notebook has been fully prepared. All you need to do is run the cells to see the complete workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Results and Insights

You will find the model's performance metrics and visualizations in the notebook. These include the accuracy score and other relevant metrics, along with a visual representation of the decision tree.
